# python-numpy-messing-about
just some messing about with python and numpy and template matching
for now a couple of weird ones
blurry-text-ocr.py - ocr through template matching -- my attempt at figuring out what the somewhat blurry (but not too blurry) text is based on extracted letter from the same text which I can correctly identify w/ 100% certainty , code adjusted ever so slightly from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50579050/template-matching-with-multiple-objects-in-opencv-python
cards-part1-done.py - basically extracting detected parts of a whole image in a form of a text -- the idea was to get the layout of a poker table and extract all the shown cards, and then to put the value of those cards through poker odds calculator api, it's not finished yet , the code is a bad horror movie :) , somewhat finished in essence, I just can't find the patience to get images of all 52 cards and properly format/crop them
